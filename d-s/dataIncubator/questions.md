Q: How does your previous experience (academia, industry) transfer to the field of data science.


As an experimental physicist, I had to wrangle large (> 1 TB) amounts of data, process and model it, and then intelligently communicate our conclusions. These three processes (wrangling, modelling and communicating) are at the core of any experimental scientists job, and the excellence that any professional experimental scientist develops over their PhD would carry over well to data science. Physicists are perhaps uniquely suited to data science, as, many of the concepts at the root of data science share much with advanced physics (high-dimensional probability theory -- statistical physics, deep learning (linear algebra) -- quantum mechanics/general relativity (tensor analysis). Though I am quite comfortable with these topics, because I am an experimental physicist I also have experience in designing experiments, taking data, cleaning the data, and generally wrangling data. 

Specifically, my work was concerned with the early-time dynamics of aggragates of topological defects embedded in a fluid. The motion and pair-anhilation of oppositly charged defects is recorded on a high-speed camera. Because the data is raw, high-resolution video with an average length of 1000 frames, the storage and analysis of the many videos needed for statistical analysis is non-trivial, so I had to develop expertise using unix tools (rsync) to backup and transfer data. The state of the art for identifying these defects and tracking their motion is tagging defects by hand (they have a 'bow-tie' shape, and lack the localized boundaries required for classical computer analysis). This severely limited analysis as, on average, it took three minutes per frame with a high burnout rate from the human doing the analyse. I led a team of students to use deep-learning methods to identify these defects, which proved successful, allowing the first high-resolution analyse of these defects. I then oversaw the writing of the paper (which was recently published), and creation of a project website/blog (mlfilms.github.io).


As a physicist specifically, whose discipline straddles both math and physical phenomena, what I would bring to data science is both my comfort and ability with higher level mathematics as well as my excellence i


, and the excellence in these areas that I have developed over the course of my PhD in experimental physics give me confidence that I would have a good start in data science.   



If physics is concered with modeling, as simply as possible, the phenomena that underlies experimental data, then data science is concerned with the data itself, and what insights can be gleaned from it.






Thoughts:
Data science is concerned with making predictions from raw data. That is, data where the underlying process concerning it bely a classical approach. A data first approach, where the first concern is building a model, that, while perhaps informed by intuition, is nonetheless primarily concered with only the data, not the phenomena that generated it.

I would like to make three points here, just from rhetorical symmetry. So, what three things about me make me uniquely suited for a role in data analysis.
