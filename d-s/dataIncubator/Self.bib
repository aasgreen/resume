	abstract = {The question of earthquake predictability is a long-standing and important challenge. Recent results [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 098501 (2007); Phys. Rev. Lett.100, 038501 (2008)] have suggested that earthquake magnitudes are clustered, thus indicating that they are not independent in contrast to what is typically assumed. Here, we present evidence that the observed magnitude correlations are to a large extent, if not entirely, an artifact due to the incompleteness of earthquake catalogs and the well-known modified Omori law. The latter leads to variations in the frequency-magnitude distribution if the distribution is constrained to those earthquakes that are close in space and time to the directly following event.},

Modern machine learning methods require large, robust training data sets to generate accurate predictions. Generating these large training sets requires a significant up-front time investment that is often impractical for small-scale applications. Here we demonstrate a `full-stack' computational solution, where the training data set is generated on-the-fly using a noise injection process to produce simulated data characteristic of the experimental system.},

	abstract = {We present a quantum memory protocol for photons that is based on the direct control of the transition dipole moment. We focus on the case where the light-matter interaction is enhanced by a cavity. We show that the optimal write process (maximizing the storage efficiency) is related to the optimal read process by a reversal of the effective time τ=∫dtg2(t)/κ, where g(t) is the time-dependent coupling and κ is the cavity decay rate. We discuss the implementation of the protocol in a rare-earth-ion–doped crystal where an optical transition can be turned on and off by switching a magnetic field.},

	abstract = {Ultralow-noise yet tunable lasers are a revolutionary tool in precision spectroscopy, displacement measurements at the standard quantum limit, and the development of advanced optical atomic clocks. Further applications include lidar, coherent communications, frequency synthesis, and precision sensors of strain, motion, and temperature. While all applications benefit from lower frequency noise, many also require a laser that is robust and compact. Here, we introduce a dual-microcavity laser that leverages one chip-integrable silica microresonator to generate tunable 1550\&\#xA0;nm laser light via stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and a second microresonator for frequency stabilization of the SBS light. This configuration reduces the fractional frequency noise to 7.8\&\#xD7;10\&\#x2212;14\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;1/\&\#x221A;Hz at 10\&\#xA0;Hz offset, which is a new regime of noise performance for a microresonator-based laser. Our system also features terahertz tunability and the potential for chip-level integration. We demonstrate the utility of our dual-microcavity laser by performing spectral linewidth measurements with hertz-level resolution.},
